## Bug

When you try the test page using join modal as client, if `Nama` isn't load Group Initial as well. Reload the tab and it doing really well. In another way if you not reload it, that okay the data will already send to group but without group initial in front of client name. If you know to fix it to get best practice. please fork this repository and create PR. I will appreciate it. Thanks
